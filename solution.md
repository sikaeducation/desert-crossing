# Desert Crossing

We need 4 cars (including the car with the important person).

All 4 cars start full.

At 1/6th of the way, all cars are 2/3rds full. One car sacrifices itself and fills up two of the other cars. Two cars are now full, one is 2/3rds full. (An empty car is left behind.)

At 2/6th of the way, two cars are 2/3rds full. One car is one third full, and sacrifices itself to fill up one of the other cars. One car is now full, one is 2/3rds full. (An empty car is left behind.)

At half way, one car is 2/3rds full. One car is one third full, and sacrifices itself to fill the other car, which is now full and can make the other half of the journey.
